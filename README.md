# Movies-ETL
## Project Overview
 save them into a SQL database so that the hackathon participants have a nice, clean dataset to use. To do this, she will follow the ETL process: extract the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, transform the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.


Create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.
